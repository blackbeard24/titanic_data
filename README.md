# Titanic_data

In this simple project I have used world famous titanic data set to demonstrate some basic functionalites of pandas
- Reading a csv file
- Performing some basic cleaning operations
- Writing the files out to another csv files

There are two notebooks in this project, 

titanic notebook performs reads single csv file and outputs two different csv files.
titanic_pull notebook reads those two csv files, joins them and outputs a single csv file.
